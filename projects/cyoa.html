            <p>My job was to make my own adventure and try to turn it into a game of sorts using my coding knowledge, like images, markdown and links. We had to pick some prompts from a list our class made in SEP and then whichever got picked as our first option by our teacher was the one for our project. The one me and my partner got was an End of the world scenario. </p>

            <p>In my project I made a small game with my partner. So to make it look like the end of the world, we made there be an earthquake for wherever our person/player was. Then we give the palyer an option to seek shelter in their home or go outside to explore. If you picked staying in your house, you died. Then there we added the option to restart the game if the player wanted to. They could keep going after that. If you picked leaving, then you see the destruction and have more options, find resources, search for people or freak out. Picking the last option makes you get a heart attack and die, so you restart. The other two paths continue the game. First one lets you pick between junk food or canned food you find in a store that was mostly in tact. Picking junk food leads you to starvation and you die. If you pick canned food, then you survive and rescue comes to save you. After that, you can restart and play again. Now, for the second option, you find a person and get the choice of saving them or leaving them. Saving is the good option and allows you to survive together until rescue comes. But if you decide to leave them, then you end up going back to looking for resources, but the store is broken down, leading to starvation. Those are pretty much all of the options and you can keep going back to restart. </p>

            <p> I think my teacher had assigned this project so that others would get to know other people well and so that we'd able to collaborate with people. It helped me practice that and to get better with elements, like the images, links and etc. I think what was most difficult about this coming up with decisions and setting up images. I didn't know how to put them in at first because I forgot how to put them in, but i got over this by searching up w3schools and getting help from there. If there was something I had to do something differently and had more time, it would be to actually customize the game page with colors or add more parts. </p>
