            <p> A project was introduced to us and the objective for this project was to create whatever we wanted. This could mean something like a website, a game, etc. So for me, I instantly wanted to choose to make a game. In my mind, I had wanted to make an RPG with dialogue and everything. However, that proved to be a bit difficult to finish within the time I had since what I had in mind was more complex and time consuming. So, I stuck to making a simple game where you have to choose between two items and guess which one was the safe option to pick. In the game, I was also able to make my own sprites for it, which has both the character that's the player and the capsules, which is what you have to pick which is safe. </p>
            <p> One of the challenges I faced during the making of this was with Kaboom itself, which was my tool for this year. Since it was really new experience for me and like many others to get into a program and learn everything about it within a short time span. There were a lot of bumps here and there, but I did eventually get a good grip on how it works. Another challenge I faced was placing in my sprites. Originally, I had made a full sprite sheet for the game, but then I struggled with a component named "SpriteAtlas", which was the way to insert sprites and the movement for it. However, I wasn't able to fully understand it so I found other ways to make it work and I eventually did find a way. This also leads to one of my takeaways which was learning that patience is key. Since there were some bumps, like this one for example, I was starting to get impatient with my project now working how I wanted it work. But I had to realize that being patient was part of the process for creating a game, of course there would be errors and bumps, so I had to take my time with understanding what went wrong and how I could've prevented it, for future reference and gaining more experience from it. </p>
            <p> On the topic of that, for the future, despite having some experience with presenting, I still need to improve more, but I think I'm slowly getting there. Another thing is I also want to improve on time management for the next time I do any kind of project since it's really important, especially given the time I had on this project, more planning could've been useful. </p>
