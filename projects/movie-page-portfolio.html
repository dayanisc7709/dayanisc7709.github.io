            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>The context behind this project is that I was supposed to come up with a film and try to create a webpage that explained the movie's plot with what I had already learned about in class. That is what I did with my two partners I had to work with, Jesus and Kiara. We created a movie called, "The three Musketeers." </p>
            
            <p>So that's the title of the movie. It's supposed to be mainly a comedy movie that people will enjoy. The plot of this movie has three lovable characters, or well that can depend actually, but three animals, a cat, a rat and a raccoon make a team to rob a bank. So as a team, they all have jobs and need to coopperate with eachother. Since the cat remain as it is, it has to distract the guards. The rat also helps with this, meanwhile the raccoon does the job of stealing all the money and gets away with it. </p>

            <p>The thing that was most difficult for this project was the initial planning we had to do for the movie, like what kind of movie it was gonna be, what genre, the plot and etc. There are a lot of ideas, but as soon as you have to think of one, your mind can go blank. Your partners may have different ideas for movies and their preferences, so that can also make it hard to agree on which movie to create. Another one of the challenges was how the website was gonna look because now that the movie part was down, there's another thing to create and that was the website. It was hard because it's the same as wanting to make up a movie with eachother. The next step I want to take is to get better at CSS so that it can be easier for me to put it into effect in websites and make them look nicer than before. </p>
