            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <p> In my class, I was prompted to make a website about any kind of topic that interested us or could be something relevant in the future for us. So that was the Freedom Project we had to do was about. For me, my topic was Fashion and I was able to make a functioning website for that certain topic. It has a lot of into on the past, present and the future of Fashion. But some challenges I faced through this was getting my website to be responsive. But I was able to get help with it through tutorials online and it sort of fixed the look of the website and it didn't look as messy as before. Another challenge I faced was using A-frame, since it was my tool, I struggled with actually tinkering with it because of me not wanting to mess up anything. But I realised the whole purpose of tinkering was doing just that and learning from those mistakes. So when I did it, I obviously made mistakes but it made it more easier for me to tinker then.</p>
            <p>A takeaway that I took from this was to have more confidence. We had to present our project in class and also to other people who didn't know anything. I wasn't very confident when I was doing mine or when presenting to other strangers as well. I think having more confidence is something I need to because I need to also be able to captivate people's attention. On the topic of that, another takeaway I had was to speak louder as well. This kind of goes with confidence, but it is still important to project my voice so that everyone can actually listen.
            </p>
            <p>For my next steps, I think I'm have to work on my takeaways for sure. At least for any other future presentations I have to do, I'll improve a little more from this experience. I also would like to get better at making websites, design wise, since mine was not very interesting as other websites were. And another thing, I wanna make sure to always remember to make my own websites responsives so it never looks off.</p>
